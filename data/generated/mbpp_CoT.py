Step 1: First, we need to understand the problem. We are given pairs of numbers and we need to find the longest chain that can be formed from these pairs. A chain is formed if the second element of one pair is smaller than the first element of the next pair. 
Step 2: We need to create a class Pair to store the pairs of numbers. This class will have an __init__ method to initialize the pairs with two numbers a and b.
Step 3: Now we need to create a function max_chain_length that will take an array of pairs and the number of pairs as arguments. This function will find the longest chain that can be formed from the given pairs.
Step 4: Inside the function, we first initialize a variable max to 0. This variable will keep track of the maximum chain length.
Step 5: We also create an array mcl of size n and initialize all its elements to 1. This array will store the maximum chain length that can be formed ending with pairs i.
Step 6: We then start a loop from the second pair to the last pair. For each pair, we check all the previous pairs.
Step 7: Inside the inner loop, we check if the first element of the current pair is greater than the second element of the previous pair and if the chain length ending with the current pair is less than the chain length ending with the previous pair plus 1. If both conditions are true, we update the chain length ending with the current pair.
Step 8: After the loops, we have the maximum chain length ending with each pair in the mcl array. We then loop through the mcl array to find the maximum chain length.
Step 9: If the chain length ending with the current pair is greater than the current maximum, we update the maximum.
Step 10: Finally, we return the maximum chain length.

Step 1: We need to create a function named 'first_repeated_char' that takes a string 'str1' as an argument. This function will be used to find the first repeated character in the given string.
Step 2: We need to iterate over the string 'str1'. For this, we can use the 'enumerate' function which returns the index and the character at that index in the string. This will allow us to check each character and its position in the string.
Step 3: Inside the loop, we need to check if the current character has appeared before in the string. We can do this by slicing the string from the start to the current index (inclusive) and counting the occurrences of the current character. If the count is greater than 1, it means that the character has repeated.
Step 4: If we find a repeated character, we should immediately return that character. This is because we are looking for the first repeated character, and as soon as we find one, we can stop the search.
Step 5: If we iterate over the entire string and do not find any repeated characters, we should return the string "None". This will indicate that no repeated characters were found in the input string.

Step 1: We need to define a function named `get_ludic` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. This function will return all ludic numbers smaller than or equal to `n`. 
Step 2: Inside the function, we first initialize an empty list `ludics` which will hold all the ludic numbers.
Step 3: We then create a for loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, we append the current number to the `ludics` list. This is because initially, all numbers from 1 to `n` are considered as potential ludic numbers.
Step 4: We then initialize an index variable with the value 1. This index will be used to access the elements in the `ludics` list.
Step 5: We then create a while loop that continues as long as the `index` is not equal to the length of the `ludics` list. This is because we need to check each number in the `ludics` list to see if it is a ludic number or not.
Step 6: Inside the while loop, we first get the ludic number at the current index. This is done by accessing the element at the `index` position in the `ludics` list.
Step 7: We then calculate the index of the number that needs to be removed from the `ludics` list. This is done by adding the current `index` and the `first_ludic` number.
Step 8: We then create another while loop that continues as long as the `remove_index` is less than the length of the `ludics` list. This is because we need to remove all numbers that are multiples of the current `first_ludic` number from the `ludics` list.
Step 9: Inside the second while loop, we first remove the number at the `remove_index` position from the `ludics` list. This is because this number is not a ludic number as it is a multiple of the current `first_ludic` number.
Step 10: We then update the `remove_index` by adding the `first_ludic` number and subtracting 1. This is done to get the index of the next number that needs to be removed from the `ludics` list.
Step 11: After the second while loop, we increment the `index` by 1. This is done to move to the next number in the `ludics` list.
Step 12: Finally, after the first while loop, we return the `ludics` list. This list now contains all the ludic numbers smaller than or equal to `n`.

Step 1: We need to create a function named 'reverse_words' that takes a string 's' as an argument. This function will reverse the words in the given string.
Step 2: The first thing we need to do inside the function is to split the string into words. We can use the split() method of the string which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. By default, split() method splits the string on spaces.
Step 3: Now we have a list of words. The next step is to reverse the order of this list. Python provides a built-in function 'reversed()' which returns a reversed iterator of a sequence. We can use this function to reverse the list of words.
Step 4: After reversing the list of words, we need to join them back into a string. We can use the join() method of the string which concatenates all the elements in the iterable (list in our case) separated by a specified delimiter. In our case, the delimiter is a space (' ').
Step 5: The final step is to return the reversed string from the function.
So, to summarize, the function will split the string into words, reverse the list of words, join them back into a string with spaces in between, and return the result.

Step 1: We need to define a function that checks if a given number is prime or not. Let's name this function as 'prime_num' and it should take one argument, which is the number to be checked.
Step 2: The definition of a prime number is a number that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. So, the first condition to check is if the number is less than 1. If it is, it cannot be a prime number. So, we return False.
Step 3: If the number is greater than or equal to 1, we need to check if it has any other divisors. We do this by looping over a range of numbers starting from 2 up to the half of the given number. We only need to check up to half of the number because a larger factor would be a multiple of a smaller factor already checked.
Step 4: For each number in the range, we check if it is a divisor of the given number. This is done by using the modulus operator (%). If the remainder of the division of the given number by the current number in the loop is zero, it means that the current number is a divisor of the given number. In this case, the given number is not a prime number, so we return False.
Step 5: If none of the numbers in the range are divisors of the given number, it means that the given number is a prime number. So, we return True.
Step 6: The final step is to write these steps in Python syntax. The 'if' statement is used to check the conditions, and the 'for' loop is used to iterate over the range of numbers. The 'return' statement is used to return the result of the function.

Step 1: First, we need to understand the problem. We are asked to write a function that converts degrees to radians. 
Step 2: We know that Python has a built-in module named 'math' which provides mathematical functions. One of the constants in the math module is 'pi' which is the mathematical constant π, to available precision. We will need this for our conversion formula.
Step 3: Let's start by importing the math module. We can do this by writing 'import math'.
Step 4: Now, we need to define our function. We can name it 'radian_degree'. This function will take one parameter, 'degree', which represents the degree that we want to convert to radians.
Step 5: Inside the function, we will use the formula to convert degrees to radians. The formula is radian = degree*(π/180). We can write this as 'radian = degree*(math.pi/180)'.
Step 6: Finally, we need to return the result. We can do this by writing 'return radian'.

Step 1: The first thing we need to do is to import the regex module. This module will allow us to perform operations involving regular expressions. In Python, this module is imported using the command 'import re'.
Step 2: Next, we need to define the pattern we are looking for in the text. In this case, the pattern is the word 'fox'. We store this pattern in a variable named 'pattern'.
Step 3: We also need to define the text in which we are searching for the pattern. In this case, the text is 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'. We store this text in a variable named 'text'.
Step 4: Now, we need to define a function that will take in the text and the pattern as parameters and return the pattern and its location within the text. We name this function 'find_literals'.
Step 5: Inside the function, we use the 'search' function from the 're' module to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text. The 'search' function returns a match object if the pattern is found in the text. If the pattern is not found, the 'search' function returns 'None'. We store the match object in a variable named 'match'.
Step 6: We then use the 'start' and 'end' methods of the match object to find the start and end positions of the pattern in the text. The 'start' method returns the index of the start of the matched substring. The 'end' method returns the index of the end of the matched substring. We store the start and end positions in variables 's' and 'e' respectively.
Step 7: Finally, we return a tuple containing the pattern and its start and end positions in the text. The pattern is accessed from the match object using the 're.pattern' attribute.

Step 1: We are asked to find the nth Bell number. Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set. We can solve this problem using dynamic programming.
Step 2: First, we need to create a two-dimensional list named 'bell' with size (n+1)x(n+1). This list will be used to store the intermediate results of the Bell numbers. We initialize all elements of this list to 0.
Step 3: The first Bell number is 1, so we set bell[0][0] = 1.
Step 4: We then start a loop from 1 to n+1. For each iteration i, we calculate the Bell number for i.
Step 5: The Bell number for i (bell[i][0]) is the same as the last number in the previous row (bell[i-1][i-1]). So we set bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1].
Step 6: We then start another loop from 1 to i+1. For each iteration j, we calculate the jth number in the ith row.
Step 7: The jth number in the ith row (bell[i][j]) is the sum of the (j-1)th number in the (i-1)th row (bell[i-1][j-1]) and the (j-1)th number in the ith row (bell[i][j-1]). So we set bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1].
Step 8: After calculating all the Bell numbers, we return the nth Bell number, which is bell[n][0].

Step 1: First, we need to understand the problem. We are given a periodic function and we need to find the minimum possible value for this function. The function is defined by three parameters: A, B, and N.
Step 2: The periodic function is not explicitly given, but we can infer from the final code that it is a linear function of the form A*x/B, where x is a variable that depends on B and N.
Step 3: The function floor_Min should take three arguments: A, B, and N. This is the first line of our function definition: def floor_Min(A,B,N):
Step 4: The next step is to determine the value of x. From the final code, we can see that x is the maximum of B - 1 and N. This means that x is either B - 1 or N, whichever is larger. This is the second line of our function: x = max(B - 1,N)
Step 5: Now that we have x, we can calculate the value of the function A*x/B. However, we need to find the floor of this value, which means we need to round down to the nearest integer. In Python, this is done using the // operator. This is the third line of our function: return (A*x) // B
Step 6: The function is now complete. It calculates the minimum possible value of the periodic function by finding the maximum of B - 1 and N, multiplying this by A, dividing by B, and rounding down to the nearest integer.

Step 1: We need to define a function that removes the k'th element from a list. The function should be named "remove_kth_element". The function should take two parameters: a list and an integer k.
Step 2: The function should return a new list that is the same as the input list, but without the k'th element. This means that the function should combine all elements before the k'th element with all elements after the k'th element.
Step 3: In Python, we can use list slicing to get all elements before the k'th element. This can be done by using the slice notation "list1[:L-1]". This will return all elements from the start of the list to the element before the k'th element.
Step 4: Similarly, we can get all elements after the k'th element by using the slice notation "list1[L:]". This will return all elements from the k'th element to the end of the list.
Step 5: We can combine these two slices by using the "+" operator. This will concatenate the two slices into a new list.
Step 6: The function should return this new list. This can be done by using the "return" keyword followed by the expression that creates the new list.

Step 2: Inside the function, we need to find the maximum value in the nth column. To do this, we can use a list comprehension to create a list of all the nth elements in each tuple in 'test_list'. 
Step 3: In the list comprehension, 'sub' represents each tuple in 'test_list' and 'sub[N]' is the nth element of each tuple.

Step 5: The zip function will return a tuple. We need to convert this tuple to a list. We can use the list function for this.

Step 3: To sum all the values in each tuple, we can use the built-in Python function 'sum'. However, if we directly apply 'sum' to the list of tuples, it will throw an error because 'sum' expects an iterable of numbers, not tuples. 
Step 4: To overcome this issue, we can use the 'map' function. The 'map' function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and returns a list of the results. 
Step 5: In this case, we want to apply the 'sum' function to each tuple in the list. So, we can use 'map(sum, test_list)' to get a list of the sums of each tuple.
Step 6: Now, we have a list of sums, and we want to find the cumulative sum of these sums. We can achieve this by applying the 'sum' function again to the list of sums. So, we can use 'sum(map(sum, test_list))' to get the cumulative sum.

Step 3: Inside the list comprehension, we need to calculate the average of each tuple. The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers in the tuple by the number of elements in the tuple. We can use the 'sum' function to calculate the sum of the numbers and the 'len' function to count the number of elements.
Step 4: To calculate the sum and length of each tuple simultaneously, we can use the 'zip' function with the asterisk operator (*). The 'zip' function returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences. The asterisk operator is used to unpack the argument sequences. This will allow us to calculate the sum and length of each tuple in a single line of code.

# Step 1: Identify the problem requirements and constraints. The problem requires us to find the longest chain that can be formed from a set of given pairs. The specific formation rules or conditions of the chain aren't clearly stated, but typically a chain in pairs involves having the second element of one pair match up with the first element of another pair. We need to make sure to understand this point fully.
# Step 2: Identify the inputs and outputs for the function. The input is a set of pairs, presumably represented as two-dimensional tuples or lists in Python. The output would be the longest chain, which could be represented as a list of pairs.
# Step 3: We need to break down the problem and think of the approach. One typical approach in these kind of problems is to use a sort of recursive approach, where you would attempt to build the chain by adding one pair at a time and checking if it can continue. If it cannot, it would backtrack and try another approach. For efficiency reasons, it might make sense to sort the pairs by their second element, to make the search for chains more efficient.
# Step 4: Start by defining the function and accepting the necessary parameters. We can write a helper function, which will perform recusion and do the hard work of finding chains. We also initialize variables to keep track of the longest chain found so far.
# Step 5: Sort the pairs by the second element, as it will provide the best efficiency for this algorithm.
# Step 6: Then, loop through the sorted pairs step by step. For each pair, we try to build a chain starting with that pair, using our helper function. If the chain that we find is longer than the longest chain we've found so far, we update our longest chain.
